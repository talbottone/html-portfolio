<h3>1. Golden Sun (GBA) and Golden Sun: The Lost Age (GBA)</h3>
<p>This was my first RPG. Thanks to it, role-playing games are my favorite genre.</p>
<h3>2. Kingdom Hearts II (PS2)</h3>
<p>Still, the gameplay of this game is second to none.</p>
<h3>3. Metroid Zero Mission (GBA)</h3>
<p>This game made me fall in love with the Metroid franchise. I still play this game at least once a year.</p>
<h3>4. Pokemon Crystal (GBC)</h3>
<p>Not only the best Pokemon game ever made, it is also one of the best games ever made, period.</p>
<h3>5. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Switch)</h3>
<p>Probably the best Zelda game ever made, even with Tears of the Kingdom in the picture.</p>
